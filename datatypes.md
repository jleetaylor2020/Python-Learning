# Data Types #
# string = a data type
# integar = 2
# float = 2.5

# The text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. An integer is a whole number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a TypeError. You can always check the data type of something using the type() function.

# Variables are names that we give to certain values in our programs. Variables = container of data - Only can be must start with a letter or _

# str() function converts a number into a string

# Example
>>> bill  = 40.00
>>> tip = bill * 0.29
>>> total = bill + tip
>>> share = 2
>>> print ("Each person pays " + str (total/share))
Each person pays 25.8

>>> numerator = 10
>>> denominator = 10
>>> result = numerator/denominator
>>> print(str(result))
