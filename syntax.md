>>> print(2**10)
1024

>>> print(((2050/5)-32)/9)
42.0

>>> print(" Programming in Python is fun! ")
 Programming in Python is fun!
 
>>> ratio = (((5**1/2)+1)/2)
>>> print(ratio)

# Notes
#  Arithmetic operators
# Python can operate with numbers using the usual mathematical operators, and some special operators, too. These are all of them (we'll explore the last two in later videos).

# a + b = Adds a and b
# a - b = Subtracts b from a
# a * b = Multiplies a and b
# a / b = Divides a by b
# a ** b = Elevates a to the power of b. For non integer values of b, this becomes a root (i.e. a**(1/2) is the square root of a)
# a // b = The integer part of the integer division of a by b
# a % b = The remainder part of the integer division of a by b
